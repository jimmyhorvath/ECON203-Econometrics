# ECON203-Econometrics
ECON-203 built on 202, expanding quantitative models and addressing data quality issues. Our Stata project analyzed NFL draft factors, including winning %, expenses, race, height, weight, SEC affiliation, and position. Key findings: QBs and linemen are more likely first-round picks, heavier linemen go earlier, and team success impacts draft stock.
